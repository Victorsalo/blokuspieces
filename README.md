# Blokus piece generator

*Disclaimer:* I have at the moment not measured the pieces for actual size but
will do so when I find the opportunity.

This is a tool to generate pieces for the game Blokus.
I created this since the set I play with had lost some pieces that
were replaced with paper pieces which were not that satisfactory.

To use it you need to be able to run OpenSCAD.
Eventually I will add a folder of all the standard polyominos precompiled.

I am at the moment sharing this under GPLv3.
I am not sure sharing this is allowed.
If you feel like you have any authority on the subject, let me know.
